## About 
A learning app as a web application for children with autism that utilizes augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) symbols to teach categorization skills. The app consists of two games with drag and drop functionality, one in which the child sorts items into different categories and the other in which the child matches symbols with corresponding words. The app utilizes the MetaCom AAC symbol system, which is already established and widely used in Austria and Germany. The app was developed using React. The project was developed in collaboration with educators to ensure that the app is pedagogically useful and the level of difficulty is appropriate for the target audience. Future work includes the check if a distribution and hosting of the app is possible and if so, implementing additional games and improving the app on a technical level.

Future work also includes improving this README.
